# ImageProcessingLib
Implementation of a basic image processing application using C++

The building block of the project will be a class that implements the image abstract data type. The
application will support only grayscale images. A grayscale image is represented by a 2D array of
pixels, and each pixel can take a value from the interval [0, 255], where the value 0 represents black,
and the value 255 represents white. Values in between encode different shades of gray (the higher the
value, the lighter the gray tone is).
