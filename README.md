# ImageProcessingLib
Implementation of a basic image processing application using C++

The building block of the project will be a class that implements the image abstract data type. The
application will support only grayscale images. A grayscale image is represented by a 2D array of
pixels, and each pixel can take a value from the interval [0, 255], where the value 0 represents black,
and the value 255 represents white. Values in between encode different shades of gray (the higher the
value, the lighter the gray tone is).

# Testes images
The project will be tested using the following images:
The images are not mine, they were taken from the following link: https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/pgma/pgma.html

# Sample images
The sample images are the following:
- 1
- 2
- 3
To convert from PGM to PNG I have used the following website: https://convertio.co/pt/pgm-png/
